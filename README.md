## LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING & ALGORITHMS
A repo that contains all the projects that I have done throughout my process of learning C. Some may be basic but some made me cry.

### Goals

- Learn C.
- The reason of pointers existence.
- Understand the importance of malloc, loops and pointers in almost every program done.
